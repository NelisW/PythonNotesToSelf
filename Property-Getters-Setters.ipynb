    "\n",
    "    spam = SomeObject()\n",
    "    print(spam.eggs)\n",
    "\n",
    "it looks up `eggs` in spam, and then examines `eggs` to see if it has a` __get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` method - if it does, it's a property. If it is a property, instead of just returning the `eggs` object (as it would for any other attribute) it will call the `__get__` method (since we were doing lookup) and return whatever that method returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a property you have complete control on its getter, setter and deleter methods, which you don't have (if not using caveats) with an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Property is a more convenient way to do data encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: If your have a public attribute `length` of Object, later on, your project requires you to encapsulate it, i.e: change it to private and provide getter and setter => you have to change many of the codes you wrote before:\n",

    "    If you use `@property` and `@length.setter` => you don't need to change those old codes\n",

    "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Descriptor is a class which provides the detailed get, set and delete control over an attribute of another object. This allows you to define attributes which are fairly complex objects in their own right. The idea is that we can use simple attribute references in a program, but those simple references are actually method functions of a descriptor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Descriptor design pattern has two parts: an Owner and an attribute Descriptor. The Owner is usually a relatively complex object that uses one or more Descriptors for its attributes. A Descriptor class defines get, set and delete methods for a class of attributes of the Owner. Each Descriptor object manages a specific attribute. Note that Descriptors will tend to be reusable, generic classes of attributes. The Owner can have multiple instances of each Descriptor class to manage attributes with similar behaviors. Each Descriptor object is a unique instance of a Descriptor class, bound to a distinct attribute name when the Owner class is defined.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The `property()` function returns a special descriptor object.\n",
    "These act as decorators too. They return a new property object.\n",
    "Remember, that the `@decorator` syntax is just syntactic sugar; the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def foo(self): \n",
    "        return self._foo\n",
    "\n",
    "really means the same thing as\n",
    "\n",
    "    def foo(self): \n",
    "        return self._foo\n",
    "    foo = property(foo)\n",
    "\n",
    "so `foo` the function is replaced by `property(foo)`, which we saw above is a special object. Then when you use `@foo.setter()`, what you are doing is call that `property().setter` method, which returns a new copy of the property, but this time with the setter function replaced with the decorated method.\n"

    "A property object has `getter`, `setter`, and `deleter` methods usable as decorators that create a copy of the property with the corresponding accessor function set to the decorated function. This is best explained with the code below. \n",
    "This code is exactly equivalent to the first example above. _Be sure to give the additional functions the same name as the original property_ (x in this case.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use decorators? See the long discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6618002/using-property-versus-getters-and-setters \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The reason is that all attributes are public in Python. Starting names with an underscore or two \n",
    "is just a warning that the given attribute is an implementation detail that may not stay the same \n",
    "in future versions of the code. It doesn't prevent you from actually getting or setting that attribute. \n",
    "Therefore, standard attribute access is the normal, Pythonic way of, well, accessing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of properties is that they are syntactically identical to attribute access, so you can \n",
    "change from one to another without any changes to client code. You could even have one version of a \n",
    "class that uses properties (say, for code-by-contract or debugging) and one that doesn't for \n",
    "production, without changing the code that uses it. At the same time, you don't have to write\n",
    "getters and setters for everything just in case you might need to better control access later.\n",
    "```\n",
